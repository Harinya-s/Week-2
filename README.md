# 🌿 Smart Pest Detection System using Deep Learning

## Week 2 Status

This week, the project **“Smart Pest Detection System using Deep Learning for Sustainable Agriculture”** continued with a focus on **data preprocessing, augmentation, and implementing transfer learning** for pest image classification.

**Activities Completed:**
- Applied data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flipping) using ImageDataGenerator.
- Split dataset into training and validation sets (80:20).
- Implemented **MobileNetV2** as the base model for transfer learning.
- Added custom dense and dropout layers to improve accuracy.
- Trained the model for initial epochs to test setup.
- Plotted accuracy and loss graphs to analyze performance.

**Results:**
- Model achieved around **70–75% validation accuracy** in the first training phase.
- Observed steady improvement in accuracy per epoch.

**Next Steps:**
- Fine-tune model hyperparameters.
- Evaluate the model using test data.
- Save the trained model for later deployment.
